describe this app!

<p>This is the login page for the Englishglue vocabulary learning web application
<p>Currently, this is just a basic front end for the intermittent re-inforecment engine which tracks the vocab a student is learning on a word by word basis, and further distinguishes between reading and writing.
<p>Each word has a reading or writing level from 0 to 3.  Each level represents a different time the word will be tested at.  For example, if the student passes a test for a word at reading level 0, the word will go up to reading level 1, and then the next test will be about a week later.  If a week later the student passes that test, the word will go up to reading level 2, and the next test for that word will be scheduled for about a month later.
<p>As this application is specifically focused on each students singular needs, it is hard to offer an effective demonstration of it in action.
<p>However, if you want to log in and see a sample students site, please use the following long information:
<p>name: guest
<p>password: pass
<p>This application is currently being re-factored to support a large number of students, so some of the functions in this old version might take a while to operate, but please be patient.
<p>There is not explanation for each funtion as currently students are guided individually with a teacher who operates the application.
