
The following caused a class cast exeption in the file.jsp page.
Strangely, it only thre this after if had worked for other files.
After a successful run, then clicking back, the programs halts.
So I'm trying a session attribute instead of a bean.

FileBean file_bean = (FileBean)session.getAttribute("FILE_KEY");
Hashtable text_defs  = file_bean.getWordsDefs();

We put all the needed variables into the session object and this solved out problem
Really the use of beas is just organizational, and at this point there is only a handful of variables
anyway, so it's not a problem now.  If it becomes a problem we may want to revisit
trying to use special purpose beans to group variables.
