        When I started learning Korean, I used to carry around a long list of words like this to study on the subway or bus.  It worked OK for a while, until, most of the words I knew, but the ones I needed to review took a while to find.  Also, when I took it out of my pocket to ask a friend about pronunciation, etc., it became embarrassing the more tattered the list got.  I started to feel like a hobo.  So I made a new list with the words I still needed to learn, as well as new ones I had collected along the way.  After a while I would find the old list and realize I had forgotten many of them, and had to transfer those to a new list, with forgotten words from other lists, as well as some new words, and the taks became unbearable.</td>

So because of all these problems, I made this program.  I wanted it to be on the web, so I could access it anywhere (even on my phone!).  I realised reading and writing were different skills, so it needed to track that also. 
<table>
  
    <tr>
      <td>So now it keeps track of all the words I am learning, as well as reminds of words I am in danger of forgetting.  I can print out a new handsome list whenever I want and all is well and good.  Th schedule for reviewing words became very important, and the power of intermittant re-enforcement became obvious.  Then I realised this program can do so much more.  It can tell me where I am in the long journey of learning a language, as well as let me know how fast I am getting there.</td>

Now I also realize that this program treats each student individually, as it does each word.  It empowers the student to manage their own learning, instead of leaving that up to teachers and administer students based on arbitrary classes and levels imposed upon them.
Therefore the future of this program is to set the students free!
Wish us luck...
